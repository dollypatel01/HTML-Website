# HTML-Website
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is used to structure content on the web, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists, and to add images, videos, links, and other multimedia.


History of HTML 
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create web pages. It was developed in the late 1980s by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. 
Tim Berners-Lee originally referenced "HTML Tags," a document that provided the first publicly accessible explanation of HTML, on the Internet in late 1991.


Getting Started 
To create an HTML file, you can use any text editor such as Notepad, Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code. 
Save the file with a .html extension. 
A basic HTML document has the following structure:
  The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
  The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
  The <head> element contains meta information about the document, such as the title of the page.
  The <title> element specifies a title for the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
  The <body> element contains the visible content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, and images. 
  
  
Elements
HTML elements are defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). Elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag.
For example, the following code creates an image element with a source attribute and an alt attribute:
The <img> element defines an image.
The src attribute specifies the URL of the image file.
The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or if the user is using a screen reader.

  
Conclusion
HTML is the foundation of the web. It provides a way to structure content and add multimedia to web pages. With the addition of CSS and JavaScript, HTML can create visually appealing and interactive web pages.
