                    <article>
                    <p>In the late 1980s, HTML was originally first used as a way for scientists to share reserach papers and other documents over the internet.</p>
                    <p>Then the first version of HTML to create web pages was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.</p>
                    <p>Tim Berners-Lee originally referenced "HTML Tags," a document that provided the first publicly accessible explanation of HTML, on the Internet in late 1991.</p>
                    <p>It defined the early, somewhat basic design of HTML, which consisted of 18 elements.</p>
                    <p>Over time, new versions of HTML started getting released introducing new features and functions.</p>
                    <p>The most recent version that was released in 2014 is HTML5 and the HTML timeline has became one of the most used programming languages on the internet. </p>

                    <article> 
                    <p>For our project, we decided to incorporate our HTML skills in making a webpage to teach and provide all the information that was supposed to be in our slides.</p>
                    <p>This webpage uses HTML and CSS to make it user friendly and look more visually appealing.</p>
                    <p>CSS was used to enhance the design and appearance of our webpage, including the font, color, and layout.</p>
                    <p>What is CSS?</p>
                    <li>CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets) is a programming language used to style webpages and the layout as well written in HTML. </li>
                    <li>It is used to control how webpages look with background colors, font style and sizes, and can help position elements on the page.</li>
                    <li>We used it to add our background color and the positioning and layout of our images.</li>
                    <p>You can also use Javascript when making webpages along with HTML. This allows for more dynamic interactions and other functionalities on the webpage. Javascript is a scripting language that can be used to create interactive effects like image sliders, dropdown bars, form validation, etc.</p>
